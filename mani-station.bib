    abstract={BackgroundAssistive technologies have the potential to facilitate everyday life of people with dementia and their families. Close collaboration with affected people and interdisciplinary research are essential to understand and address the needs of prospective users. In this study, we present the results of the evaluation of such an assistive system prototype.AimsChallenges from the patient and caregiver side, technical and design problems and acceptance and usability with regard to our special target group were evaluated.MethodsMEMENTO, a system of two e-ink tablets and a smartwatch, was tested in the domestic environment of dementia patients. Thirty participants from Italy, Spain and Austria took part in a 3-month field trial and compared the MEMENTO system to traditional strategies in everyday life. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and frequency of use of the system was monitored.ResultsThere were no significant changes in quantitative measurements, such as activities of daily living and caregiver burden over the duration of the 3-month field trial. More frequent usage was significantly correlated with positive attitude towards technology (r = 0.723, p < 0.05), but not with age. The design of the system was positively emphasized, reducing fear of the technology on the one hand and stigmatization on the other.ConclusionWe show that a positive attitude towards technology is the essential variable for successful implementation of such systems, regardless of age. Participants showed great interest in digital solutions and agreed that technological systems will help in maintaining independency of persons with cognitive dysfunction in the future.},

abstract={This cross-country survey research investigated the relationship between screen addiction and media multitasking and examined factors that mediate and moderate this relationship. The web survey recruited Internet users owning multiple devices in the United States (N = 798) and Taiwan (N = 834). Although American users spent longer time on screen devices and engaged more in media multitasking more, Taiwanese respondents had higher screen addiction. Results showed that media multitasking and screen device use were positively related to screen addiction. Country of respondents’ residence moderated the relationship between media multitasking and screen addiction. Additionally, screen device usage mediated the positive effects of media multitasking on screen addiction. Finally, leisure boredom moderated screen device usage’s mediating effects on the relationship between media multitasking and screen addiction, which differed in two countries. Young people and females tended to have high levels of screen addiction. Implications of screen addiction and media multitasking were discussed.},

title={To Each Stress Its Own Screen: A Cross-Sectional Survey of the Patterns of Stress and Various Screen Uses in Relation to Self-Admitted Screen Addiction},
journal={Journal of Medical Internet Research},
volume={21},
number={4},
abstract={Background: The relationship between stress and screen addiction is often studied by exploring a single aspect of screen-related behavior in terms of maladaptive dependency or the risks associated with the content. Generally, little attention is given to the pattern of using different screens for different types of stressors, and variations arising from the subjective perception of stress and screen addiction are often neglected. Given that both addiction and stress are complex and multidimensional factors, we performed a multivariate analysis of the link between individual’s subjective perceptions of screen addiction, various types of stress, and the pattern of screen usage. Objective: Using the media-repertoires framework to study usage patterns, we explored (1) the relation between subjective and quantitative assessments of stress and screen addiction; and (2) differences in stress types in relation to subjective screen addiction and different types of needs for screens. We hypothesized that interindividual heterogeneity in screen-related behavior would reflect coping differences in dealing with different stressors. Methods: A multifactorial Web-based survey was conducted to gather data about screen-related behaviors (such as screen time, internet addiction, and salience of different types of screens and related activities), and different sources of stress (emotional states, perceptual risks, health problems, and general life domain satisfaction). We performed group comparisons based on whether participants reported themselves as addicted to internet and games (A1) or not (A0), and whether they had experienced a major life stress (S1) or not (S0). Results: Complete responses were obtained in 459 out of 654 survey responders, with the majority in the S1A0 (44.6%, 205/459) group, followed by S0A0 (25.9%, 119/459), S1A1 (19.8%, 91/459), and S0A1 (9.5%, 44/459). The S1A1 group was significantly different from S0A0 in all types of stress, internet overuse, and screen time (P<.001). Groups did not differ in rating screens important for short message service (SMS) or mail, searching information, shopping, and following the news, but a greater majority of A1 depended on screens for entertainment (χ23=20.5; P<.001), gaming (χ23=35.6; P<.001), and social networking (χ23=26.5; P<.001). Those who depended on screens for entertainment and social networking had up to 19% more emotional stress and up to 14% more perceptual stress. In contrast, those who relied on screens for work and professional networking had up to 10% higher levels of life satisfaction. Regression models including age, gender, and 4 stress types explained less than 30% of variation in internet use and less than 24% of the likelihood of being screen addicted. Conclusions: We showed a robust but heterogeneous link between screen dependency and emotional and perceptual stressors that shift the pattern of screen usage toward entertainment and social networking. Our findings underline the potential of using ludic and interactive apps for intervention against stress.},

pages={491-511},
abstract={This paper establishes a Kantian duty against screen overexposure. After defining screen exposure, I adopt a Kantian approach to its morality on the ground that Kant’s notion of duties to oneself easily captures wrongdoing in absence of harm or wrong to others. Then, I draw specifically on Kant’s ‘duties to oneself as an animal being’ to introduce a duty of self-government. This duty is based on the negative causal impact of the activities it regulates on a human being’s mental and physical powers, and, ultimately, on the moral employment of these powers. After doing so, I argue that the duty against screen overexposure is an instance of the duty of self-government. Finally, I consider some objections.},

    abstract={Science fiction has long promised the digitalization of books. Characters in films and television routinely check their palm-sized (or smaller) electronic displays for fast-scrolling information. However, this very technology, increasingly prevalent in today’s world, has not been embraced universally. While the convenience of pocket-sized information pieces has the techno-savvy entranced, the general public still greets the advent of the e-book with a curious reluctance. This lack of enthusiasm seems strange in the face of the many advantages offered by the new medium—vastly superior storage capacity, searchability, portability, lower cost, and instantaneous access. This dissertation addresses the need for research examining the reading comprehension and the role emotional response plays in the perceived performance on e-document formats as compared to traditional paper format. This study compares the relative reading comprehension on three formats (Kindle, iTouch, and paper) and examines the relationship of subject’s emotional response and relative technology exposure as factors that affect how the subject perceives they have performed on those formats. This study demonstrates that, for basic reading comprehension, the medium does not matter. Furthermore, it shows that, the more uncomfortable a person is with technology and expertise in the requested task (in this case, reading), the more they cling to the belief that they will do better on traditional (paper) media—regardless of how well they actually do.},

    abstract={Increasingly higher demands are being made on the capacity‐limited cognitive capabilities of human operators as they strive to maintain situation awareness (i.e., understanding “what is going on”) and performance in complex tasks. In the current study we asked whether: (a) training administered via a mobile phone‐based app could improve multitasking and (b) improved multitasking in the app would generalize to improved performance and situation awareness in a simulated air traffic control task (ATC). Participants completed the ATC task before and after multiple sessions of app‐based multitasking training or control training. Multitasking on the app improved across training sessions. However, this did not lead to improved performance or situation awareness, or workload reduction, relative to control training on the ATC task. These outcomes indicate that app‐based multitasking training based on repetition of a single training task will not necessarily yield generalizable benefits to human performance in other complex dynamic tasks.},

    volume={84},
    pages={29},
    abstract={In this paper we will present studies aimed at uncovering the attitudes, needs, and expectations people have towards novel types of urban computing technologies deployed in a city. First, we conducted a storytelling competition to elicit future visions of how people imagined the role of technology. Second, we conducted a rapid ethnographic study using a mock-up prototype device in various public locations to gain a deeper understanding of how people would appropriate a specific technology, namely interactive public displays. Lastly, we collected ethnographic material through a diary study and interviews where people recorded their use of existing technology, and through these experiences, imagine how future technologies might affect their lives. We found that these methods proved useful in engaging a city's community to imagine the city's future. Consequently, we were able to explore the current use of technologies in the city and project their possible future use. Contrary to previous speculation in academic and cyberpunk literature, we conclude that digital technologies will not necessarily induce an abandonment of physical urban spaces. Rather, we project an increased sophistication in the sociable uses of urban spaces and technologies, where people blend their online and offline worlds into a single lived reality.

abstract={Rust is an innovative programming language initially implemented by Mozilla, developed to ensure high performance, reliability, and productivity. The final purpose of this study consists of applying a set of common static software metrics to programs written in Rust to assess the verbosity, understandability, organization, complexity, and maintainability of the language. To that extent, nine different implementations of algorithms available in different languages were selected. We computed a set of metrics for Rust, comparing them with the ones obtained from C and a set of object-oriented languages: C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript. To parse the software artifacts and compute the metrics, it was leveraged a tool called rust-code-analysis that was extended with a software module, written in Python, with the aim of uniforming and comparing the results. The Rust code had an average verbosity in terms of the raw size of the code. It exposed the most structured source organization in terms of the number of methods. Rust code had a better Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Metrics, and Maintainability Indexes than C and C++ but performed worse than the other considered object-oriented languages. Lastly, the Rust code exhibited the lowest COGNITIVE complexity of all languages. The collected measures prove that the Rust language has average complexity and maintainability compared to a set of popular languages. It is more easily maintainable and less complex than the C and C++ languages, which can be considered syntactically similar. These results, paired with the memory safety and safe concurrency characteristics of the language, can encourage wider adoption of the language of Rust in substitution of the C language in both the open-source and industrial environments.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications requires high computational efficiency, low-cost, and low-power solutions for various IoT devices. These include a wide range of microcontrollers that are used to collect, process, and transmit IoT data. ESP32 is a microcontroller with built-in wireless connectivity, suitable for various IoT applications. The ESP32 chip is gaining more popularity, both in academia and in the developer community, supported by a number of software libraries and programming languages. While low- and middle-level languages, such as C/C++ and Rust, are believed to be the most efficient, TinyGo and MicroPython are more developer-friendly low-complexity languages, suitable for beginners and allowing more rapid coding. This paper evaluates the efficiency of the available ESP32 programming languages, namely C/C++, MicroPython, Rust, and TinyGo, by comparing their execution performance. Several popular data and signal processing algorithms were implemented in these languages, and their execution times were compared: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Infinite Impulse Response (IIR), and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. The results show that the C/C++ implementations were fastest in most cases, closely followed by TinyGo and Rust, while MicroPython programs were many times slower than implementations in other programming languages. Therefore, the C/C++, TinyGo, and Rust languages are more suitable when execution and response time are the key factors, while Python can be used for less strict system requirements, enabling a faster and less complicated development process.},
